# TSP-AI-Homework README

When you first open the project, you will be met with the Main.java file. In this file, you only need to run the project. After running, you will be met with the first requirement of the project: You need to choose how many cities you want your salesman to go to.

In the second requirement, you will need to choose how you want your input to be given:

Press 1 to input and then input the number of cities you want between 1 and 100 after that a random adjacency list will be generated.
Press 2 to input the adjacency list entered in the .txt file .  File path for .txt  file : src\main\resources\AdjacencyListInputs.txt

After that, you will see the adjacency list representation of the graph.

Then, you will be presented with information regarding the 3 methods used: BFS, UCS, and A*.

For each of these methods, you will have the best path to choose, the minimum cost to visit all cities, and the time that was required to run each method.
